ARRAYLISTS
- Used to create a dynamic array - can increase/decrease size according to requirement
- Arraylist class provides read and write functionalities
- Arraylist follows the sequence of insertion order
- Arraylists are not synchronized and it may contain duplicate elements

- ArrayList<E>() is used to create an empty arraylist
- ArrayList(capacity: Int) is used to create an Arraylist if a specified capacity
- ArrayList(elements: Collection<E>) is used to create an Arraylist filled with the elements of a collection

-Functions of ArrayList:
-   open fun add(element: E): Boolean -> used to add the specific element into the collection
-   open fun clear() -> used to remove all elements from the collection
-   open fun get(index: Int): E -> used to return the element at the specified index in the list
-   open fun remove(element: E): Boolean -> used to remove a single instance of the specified element from the current collection if it's available


LAMBDA EXPRESSIONS
- Lambda is a function that has no name
- Lambda expressions and anonymous functions are 'function literals', i.e. functions that are not declared, but passed immediately as an expression
- Lambda is defined with curly braces {} which take variables as a parameter and a body of a function
- The body of a function is written after thje variable followed by -> operator
- Syntax: {variable(s) -> body of lambda}

- Ex:
-   val sum: (Int, Int) -> Int = {a: Int, b: Int -> a+b}
-   println(sum(10,5))
- Ex:
-   val sum = {a:Int, b:Int -> println(a+b)}
-   sum(10,5)

VISIBILITY MODIFIERS
- Visibility Modifiers are the keywords which are used to restrict the sue of classes, interfaces, methods, and properties in Kotlin
- These modifiers are used at multiple places such as class header or method body
- Visibility modifiers are categorized into four different types:
-   public, private, protected, and internal

- Public Modifiers
-   A public modifier element is accessible from everywhere in the project
-   It is a default modifier in Kotlin. If any class, interface, etc. are not specified with any access/visibility modifier
        then that class, interface, etc. is used in a public scope.
-   All public declarations can be placed at the top of the file
-   If a member of a class is not specified then it is by default public.

- Private modifiers
-   A private modifier allows the element to be accessible only within the block in which properties, fields, etc. are declared
-   The private modifier declaration does not allow access outside the scope
-   A private package can be accessible within that specific file

- Internal Modifier
-   The internal modifier is a feature in Kotlin, which is not available in Java.
-   The internal modifier makes the field visible only inside the module in which it is implemented
-   All the fields are declared as internal which are accessible only inside the module in whic they are implemented

- Open Keyword
-   In Kotlin, all classes are final by default. They can't be inherited by default.
-   In Java, it's the opposite - you have to make your class final explicitly
-   Use the open keyword to make your class inheritable

- Protected Modifier
-   A protected modifier with a class or an interface allows visibility to its class or subclass only
-   A protected declaration (when overriden) in tis subclass is also protected unless it is explicitly changed
-   The protected modifier cannot be declared at top level (for packages)


NESTED AND INNER CLASS
-   Nested class is a class inside another class
-   In Kotlin, a nested class is by default static, so its data members and member functions can be accessed
        without creating an object of the class
-   Nested classes cannot access the data members of outer classes

-   Inner class is a class which is created inside another class with keyword "inner"
-   In other words, we can say that a nested class which is marked as "inner" is called inner class
-   Inner class cannot be declared inside interfaces or non-inner nested classes.
-   The advantage of inner class over nested class is that it is able to access members of tis outer class even if its private.


- UNSAFE/SAFE CAST OPERATORS
- Sometimes it is not possible to ccast a variable and it throws an exception; this is called an unsafe cast.
- the unsafe cast is performed by the infix operator "as"
- Trying to cast an integer value fo the Any type into a string leads to a ClassCastException
- Ex:
-   val obj: Any = 123
-   val str: String = obj as String
-   //Throws java.lang.ClassCastException: java.lang.Integer cannot be cast to java.lang.String

- Nullable for casting to work
- Source and target variables need to be a nullable for casting to work

-Safe cast operator
- "as?" provides a safe cast operatiohn to safely cast to a type
- it returns null if casting is not possible rather than throwing a ClassCastException

- EXCEPTION HANDLING
- You can have multiple catch blocks in a try/catch/finally block!
- Each catch can be for a different type of error.
- The requirement of NESTED TRY CATCH BLOCKS arises when a block of code generates an exception
    and within that block another code statement also generates another exception
